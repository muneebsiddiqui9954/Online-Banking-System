About this Program:


This C++ program simulates a simple online banking system with classes for Transaction, User, and Account. The Transaction class records the type, amount, and date of a transaction. The User class stores user information like name and email. The Account class manages account details, balance, and transaction history, and provides functionalities to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and view transaction history. The main function offers a menu-driven interface for users to interact with these features, including error handling for invalid operations such as negative amounts and insufficient funds.
